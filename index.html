            <p class="fade-in delay-1">
                An invisible phenomenon from outer space can have a profound impact on modern life on Earth.
                When the Sun releases bursts of energy in the form of geomagnetic storms, high-energy particles can
                strike Earth’s magnetic field.
            </p>
            <p class="fade-in delay-2">
                These interactions trigger mesmerizing auroras in polar skies — a beautiful yet dangerous side effect.
                But the impact goes beyond the skies: satellites can malfunction, GPS signals may be disrupted, and
                power grids face serious risks.

                            <h3>Aurora Borealis</h3>
                            <p>Auroras are captivating natural light displays that appear in the polar night skies,
                                resembling colorful curtains in hues of green, red, purple, and blue. They occur when
                                charged
                                particles from the Sun—released during solar flares or coronal mass ejections—collide
                                with
                                Earth’s magnetic field and atmospheric gases like oxygen and nitrogen. These
                                interactions,
                                happening in the ionosphere and magnetosphere, produce glowing emissions and serve as
                                indicators of space weather activity. Aurora borealis appears in the northern
                                hemisphere, while
                                aurora australis occurs in the southern, typically during clear nights with heightened
                                solar
                                activity.
                                Beyond their visual splendor, auroras have significant technical and cultural
                                implications.
                                Geomagnetic disturbances linked to auroras can disrupt radio communications, GPS
                                systems,
                                satellites, and even power grids—posing risks to modern infrastructure and polar flight
                                routes.
                                Culturally, auroras are woven into the folklore of Indigenous communities, often seen as
                                spiritual
                                signs. Scientifically, they offer valuable insights into Earth’s magnetic field and
                                atmospheric
                                dynamics, making them essential subjects in space weather research and observation.

                            <h3>Meteor Shower</h3>
                            <p>Meteor showers are dazzling celestial events where numerous meteors streak across the
                                night
                                sky, often appearing as “shooting stars.” These meteors are fragments from comets or
                                asteroids
                                that ignite upon entering Earth’s atmosphere. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes
                                through
                                debris trails left by these celestial bodies, with famous showers like the Perseids,
                                Leonids, and
                                Geminids recurring annually. While most meteors burn up harmlessly, rare larger ones may
                                survive and land as meteorites, occasionally causing localized damage.
                                Beyond their visual spectacle, meteor showers carry scientific and cultural
                                significance.
                                Researchers study them to uncover insights into the composition of space debris and the
                                evolution of our solar system. Culturally, meteors are often linked to myths and
                                spiritual beliefs
                                across societies. Today, meteor showers also play a role in astronomy tourism and
                                education,
                                fostering a deeper appreciation for the universe and our place within it.

                                <h3>Coronal Mass Ejection - Page 1</h3>
                                <p>Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are powerful eruptions of solar plasma and magnetic
                                    fields from
                                    the Sun’s corona, capable of releasing billions of tons of charged particles into
                                    space at high
                                    speeds. These events often accompany solar flares but can occur independently,
                                    especially
                                    during periods of intense solar activity. CMEs result from the buildup and sudden
                                    release of
                                    magnetic energy in the Sun’s atmosphere, where twisted magnetic field lines become
                                    unstable
                                    and eject solar material outward. When directed toward Earth, CMEs can reach the
                                    planet
                                    within one to three days and significantly affect space weather.
                                    Upon arrival, CMEs can trigger geomagnetic storms that disturb Earth’s
                                    magnetosphere,
                                    producing auroras and disrupting satellite operations, GPS, and radio
                                    communications. They
                                    also pose risks to astronauts and high-altitude flights, and in severe cases, can
                                    induce electric
                                    currents in power grids, leading to equipment damage or outages. Beyond these

                                    impacts, CMEs are vital to understanding solar dynamics and planetary interactions.
                                    Continuous
                                    monitoring and research are essential for developing early warning systems and

                                <h3>Solar Radiation - Page 2</h3>
                                <p>Solar radiation is the electromagnetic energy emitted by the Sun, reaching Earth as
                                    light and
                                    heat across various wavelengths, including visible light, ultraviolet (UV), and
                                    infrared. It is vital
                                    for life—driving photosynthesis, regulating climate, and enabling solar energy—but
                                    excessive
                                    exposure, especially to UV rays, can harm living organisms and disrupt technology.
                                    This
                                    radiation originates from nuclear fusion in the Sun’s core and varies with solar
                                    activity like
                                    sunspots, flares, and coronal mass ejections, which can temporarily intensify the
                                    radiation
                                    reaching Earth.
                                    While solar radiation benefits ecosystems and supports renewable energy, it also
                                    poses risks to
                                    human health and technological systems. High UV levels can damage skin and increase
                                    cancer
                                    risk, while intense solar storms may interfere with satellites, GPS, and
                                    communications. Its
                                    broader impact spans climate regulation, infrastructure resilience, and space
                                    exploration.
                                    Protective measures and continuous monitoring are essential to manage these effects,
                                    making

                                <h3>Solar Flares - Page 3</h3>
                                <p>Solar flares are powerful bursts of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun’s surface,
                                    often
                                    occurring near sunspots due to magnetic reconnection. These eruptions release energy
                                    across
                                    the spectrum, including X-rays and ultraviolet light, and can last from minutes to
                                    hours. Solar
                                    flares are closely tied to the Sun’s magnetic activity and tend to peak during the
                                    11-year solar
                                    cycle. They may occur alongside coronal mass ejections (CMEs) or independently, and
                                    are a
                                    major driver of space weather, capable of affecting regions far beyond the Sun.
                                    When directed toward Earth, solar flares can disrupt the ionosphere, interfering
                                    with radio
                                    communications, GPS systems, and satellite operations. They pose radiation risks to
                                    astronauts
                                    and high-altitude flights, especially near polar routes, and may trigger geomagnetic
                                    storms when
                                    accompanied by CMEs. These impacts extend to aviation, space exploration, and
